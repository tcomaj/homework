# Homework brief

## Expected output:
![Alt text](output.png?raw=true "Expected output")

## Criterias:
1) Focus on CSS class naming convention - classes/components should be reusable
2) Focus on Javascript best practices - use ES5 (prefered) or ES6 syntax
3) Use pure Javascript only
4) Use pure CSS only
5) Inject/replace pricing data (with JS) into the DOM (`$XX.XX` placeholders) by using the `__DATA__` object defined in `index.html`
6) Plan selector (1-year, 2-year, 3-year) should work
    - preselected option can be configured from JS (default value is 2 years)
    - when user selects particular option from plan selecter -> then the related (to the option) URL should be passed into the button. (Example: Once user clicks on Buy now button and 3-year option is selected than he/she will be redirected to https://url-3-years.com)
7) Output should be delivered to us in Git (Github, Bitbucket etc.) repository or as a .zip file



## Assets
- Copy: `copy.txt`
- Images: in `images` folder
- Colors: grab them with color picker <i>(don't bother with exact color/gradient values)</i>
- Fonts: use e.g. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat#standard-styles">Montserrat</a>

‚òùÔ∏èWe are not interested in pixel perfect job. We are interested in code quality (logical, reusable structure, easy to read, best practices, etc.)
